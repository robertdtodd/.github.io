I am a learning technology pioneer who helps people learn about technology. Artificial Intelligence is the most momentus invention in the history of humanity and it has the potential to help us create a better world for all of us - if we make the right choices. I believe the first step in making those choices is to understand what intelligence is and what it can and cannot do for us.
